This directory will contain `.rds` files of log-ratios between all taxa computed for all samples, at each taxonomic level. For instance, at the phylum level, it is a sample x ratios matrix where columns correspond to Firmicutes/Bacteroidota, Firmicutes/Actinobacteriota, Firmicutes/Proteobacteria, etc.
These matrices were computed with the [04a_LogRatios-Taxa.R](../../../../scripts/analysis-combined/04a_LogRatios-Taxa.R) script.
