# Assign taxonomy

This directory is to assign taxonomy to your list of ASVs inferred from each study, using the Silva reference database. It allows to assign taxonomy on a computer cluster instead of running it on your local computer.

**Necessary elements**:
1. **Fasta files containing the Silva reference database** must be put in the `silva-taxonomic-ref/` subdirectory (see README file in the [silva-taxonomic-ref](./silva-taxonomic-ref/) subdirectory)
2. **Input ASV tables** in the `input/` subdirectory with samples as rows and ASV sequences in column names. These input ASV tables should have no chimera and are generated by the scripts `01_Dada2-NameDataset.Rmd` in each individual dataset subdirectory of [analysis-individual](../../../../../scripts/analysis-individual/)
3. **R script** to assign taxonomy on all datasets present in the `input/` subdirectory => `Rscript_assignTaxonomy_cluster.R` is already provided in this directory, but _make sure to change the file paths at the top of the R script!!_
4. **Bash script** to execute the [R script](./Rscript_assignTaxonomy_cluster.R) on your computer cluster (recommended to provide at least XXXXX of virtual memory!). Make sure to modify the [bash script](./bash_assignTaxonomy_cluster.sh) provided in this directory to fit your cluster.
