# Assign taxonomy input

This directory should contain ASV tables saved as `.rds` objects. These ASV tables are generated during the preprocessing of fastq files, by the scripts `01_Dada2-NameDataset.Rmd` in each individual dataset subdirectory of [analysis-individual](../../../../../scripts/analysis-individual/).

Files should be named following this pattern: `seqtable_NameDataset.rds`.
