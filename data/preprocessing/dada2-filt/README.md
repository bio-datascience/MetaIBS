# Read count

This directory contains the number of reads per sample before and after the DADA2 pipeline (for each dataset).
- Before: number of reads in the raw .fastq files
- After: in the ASV table generated from the DADA2 scripts (found in each subdirectory of [analysis-individual](../../scripts/analysis-individual/)). Eukaryotic or unknown ASVs have not been removed yet.
