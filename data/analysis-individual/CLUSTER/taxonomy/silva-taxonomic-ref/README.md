# Silva reference database

In this directory, put the Silva taxonomic reference fastas.
- to reproduce results of the paper, you can use the fasta files in this directory that are Silva v138.1 (downloaded from https://zenodo.org/record/4587955)
- to have the latest Silva version, you can download the reference fastas DADA2-formatted from [the DADA2 website](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html)

You should have two files:
- `silva_nr99_v138.1_train_set.fa.gz`
- `silva_species_assignment_v138.1.fa.gz`
