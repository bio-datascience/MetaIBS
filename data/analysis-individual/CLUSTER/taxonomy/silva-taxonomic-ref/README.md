# Silva reference database

In this directory, put the Silva taxonomic reference fastas.
- to reproduce results of the paper, download the fasta files from our zenodo link (ADD LINK), where we used Silva v138
- to have the latest Silva version, download the reference fastas DADA2-formatted from [the DADA2 website](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/training.html)

You should have two files:
- silva_nr_v138_train_set.fa.gz
- silva_species_assignment_v138.fa.gz
