# Phylogenetic tree input

This directory should contain phyloseq objects saved as `.rds` objects. These phyloseq objects are generated during the preprocessing of fastq files, by the scripts `01_Dada2-NameDataset.Rmd` in each individual dataset subdirectory of [analysis-individual](../../../../../../scripts/analysis-individual/).

Files should be named following this pattern: `physeq_NameDataset.rds`.
