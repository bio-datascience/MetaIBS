# raw_fastq (Liu)

The fastq files were downloaded with the SRA-toolkit by executing the `download_fastq_liu.sh` script (the sra-toolkit downloaded the list of samples in `list_files_liu.txt`).

Instructions to download the SRA-toolkit can be found [here](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools/wiki/02.-Installing-SRA-Toolkit).
