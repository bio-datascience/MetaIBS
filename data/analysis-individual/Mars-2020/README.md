- `01_Dada2-Mars/` will contain .rds files saved as checkpoints & also for a quicker html output of the 01_Dada2-Mars.Rmd notebook;
- `03_EDA-Mars/` will contain .rds files saved as checkpoints & also for a quicker html output of the 03_EDA-Mars.Rmd notebook, and it will also contain plots generated from that script;
- `filtered2/` will contain the .fastq files generated from quality filtering.
