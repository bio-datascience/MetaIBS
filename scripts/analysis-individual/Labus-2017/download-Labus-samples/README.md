Samples from the Labus dataset on the SRA have weird quality profile (and are 1200bp long...). We recommend downloading the `.fastq` files directly from the [ENA database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA373876) instead: click on "Download All" above "Generated FASTQ files:FTP"

As an alternative, you can also get the fastq files directly from the `data/` folder from our Zenodo (ADD LINK).
