## Samples
- **72 total**
- 1st time point: 12 healthy & 27 IBS
- 2nd time point: 12 healthy & 21 IBS
=> Total 24 IBS & 48 healthy samples

## Data Quality
- **Technology** - Illumina MiSeq, paired end
- **Nb of reads per sample** - mean of 68,693 reads per sample (1,633 - 129,697)
- **Read length** - ~300 bp
- **Quality** - excellent
- **Per base sequence content** - first few bases are always the same (corresponding to primer), then base content is fluctuating, as expected.
