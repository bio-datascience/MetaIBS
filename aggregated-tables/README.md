# Taxa aggregation

This directory contains tables of aggregated taxa for each dataset. The code used to obtain these .csv files is in the _aggregation.R_ file.

For each dataset, taxa were aggregated at all taxonomic levels (from Genus to Phylum). The counts correspond to the **absolute count** (no normalization of total count per sample!!). Tables contain the available covariates, too.

For Johannes: try the **Zhu-2019** dataset first!
